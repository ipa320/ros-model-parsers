This Ros package holds python interpreters for the [ROS models](https://github.com/ipa320/ros-model/) created using the [SeRoNet toolchain](https://www.seronet-projekt.de/platform/tooling.html). These models (.ros and .rossystem extensions) can be used to describe ROS nodes, their interaction and the instantiation at runtime for further information please check the [ROS model tutorials](https://github.com/ipa320/ros-model/#tutorials).


In addition, the Toolchain offers automatic extractors of the models from the original ROS code, on one hand with [static code analyzers](https://github.com/ipa320/ros-model-cloud) (based on [HAROS](https://github.com/git-afsantos/haros)) and on the other hand with [introspectors at runtime](https://github.com/ipa320/ros_graph_parser/).

For the static code analysis we made available a web interface able to inspect code hosted on Git and get its model representation as feedback [http://ros-model.seronet-project.de/](http://ros-model.seronet-project.de/).


## Install with ROS
1. clone this repository into the source folder in your workspace, such as:
   ```
   ws/src/ros2model
   ```
2. Source ROS workspace
   ```
   source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
   ```
3. Back to the folder "ws", create venv
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv --system-site-packages --symlinks
   ```
4. Install poetry and install dependencies
   run
   ```
   pip install poetry
   poetry install -C src/ros2model/
   ```
5. compile it as ROS package
   ```
   colcon build --packages-select ros2model --symlink-install
   ```

## Run
1. Create ros node models from a run-time system:
    ```

    ros2 model node -o test/nodes # it will save generated file in folder "test/nodes"
    ```

    You can run the command below to get more usage information.
    ```
    ros2 model node -h
    ```

    ```
    usage: ros2 model node [-h] [--spin-time SPIN_TIME] [-s] [--no-daemon] [-o OUTPUT_FOLDER] [--include_hidden_nodes]
                        [--include_hidden_interfaces]

    Create .ros2 for each node in a runtime system

    options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --spin-time SPIN_TIME
                            Spin time in seconds to wait for discovery (only applies when not using an already running daemon)
    -s, --use-sim-time    Enable ROS simulation time
    --no-daemon           Do not spawn nor use an already running daemon
    -o OUTPUT_FOLDER, --output_folder OUTPUT_FOLDER
                            The folder for storing the generated models.
    --include_hidden_nodes
                            Consider hidden nodes.
    --include_hidden_interfaces
                            Consider hidden topics, services or actions.
    ```

2. Create a ros system model from a run-time system:
    ```
    ros2 model system -o test/turtlesim # save the system in test folder and named as "turtlesim.rossystem"
    ```
    You can run the command below to get more usage information.
    ```
    ros2 model system -h
    ```
    ```
    usage: ros2 model system [-h] [--spin-time SPIN_TIME] [-s] [--no-daemon] [-o OUTPUT_FILE] [--include_hidden_nodes]
                         [--include_hidden_interfaces]

    Create .rossystem for a runtime system

    options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --spin-time SPIN_TIME
                            Spin time in seconds to wait for discovery (only applies when not using an already running daemon)
    -s, --use-sim-time    Enable ROS simulation time
    --no-daemon           Do not spawn nor use an already running daemon
    -o OUTPUT_FILE, --output_file OUTPUT_FILE
                            The system model file path.
    --include_hidden_nodes
                            Consider hidden nodes.
    --include_hidden_interfaces
                            Consider hidden topics, services or actions.
    ```
